# SkyrimAlchemyTool
A tool to aid in Skyrim potion making.

This program will display ingredients by effect and vice versa, your inventory/learned effects, potions that may be brewed given a set of ingredients and parameters, and it can tell you the least number of potions you should brew to learn each ingredient's effects so you don't even need to use it ever again.

Currently, it only does those first 2 things and may be missing information/contain incorrect information as I typed the json file myself. It's definitely missing everything from Rare Curios as well as Berit's Ashes.

Note: this program does not interface with the game in any way
